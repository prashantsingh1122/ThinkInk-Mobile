# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## FRONTEND UI DEPENDENCIES
# npm install react-native-paper @expo/vector-icons
react-native-paper: For beautiful, mobile-friendly UI components.
@expo/vector-icons: For a wide range of icons that work seamlessly with Expo.
2. (Optional but recommended) Install and configure react-native-safe-area-context:
Expo already includes this, but if you ever eject or want to be explicit:

## npm install react-native-safe-area-context
Expo already includes this, but if you ever eject or want to be explicit:

This helps your UI avoid notches and system bars.
## npm install moti

But for most use cases, you can use the built-in Animated API or just stick with react-native-paper for smooth UI.
